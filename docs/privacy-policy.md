# Post Quality Index for HotCopper — Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 1 November 2025

## Summary

This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or browsing data. It runs entirely in your browser and modifies the display of HotCopper thread pages by adding a PQI badge calculated from visible counts.

## Data handling

* **Data collected:** none
* **Data shared:** none
* **Storage:** none (no local storage beyond the extension’s static files)

## How it works

The extension reads the on‑page **GA** and **Posts** numbers adjacent to each username, computes **PQI = (GA ÷ Posts) × 100**, and injects a small badge next to those stats. No information is sent off‑device.

## Permissions

The extension requests access only to pages on `hotcopper.com.au` to render the badge.

## Changes to this policy

If this policy changes, updates will be committed to the repository and the "Effective date" above will be revised.
